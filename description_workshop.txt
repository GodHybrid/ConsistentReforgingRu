This mod improves reforging by making it [b]less random[/b] without being too cheaty

1. Adds an [b]"Undo"[/b] button so that you can go back to the prefix you accidently skipped while spamming reforge
2. Prevents [b]duplicate rolls[/b] of prefixes if they have been rolled before (by default the last 8, configurable)

Notes:
* Undoing costs no money
* "Undo" button is only visible in the vanilla reforge menu. If other mods (such as "AutoReforge") replace it, it will not exist
* (In that case, Feature #2 will still work when reforging)
* The config contains multiple customizations you can do
