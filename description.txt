The Consistent Reforging mod strives to improve reforging to make it less random.

1. Adds an "Undo" button so that you can go back to the prefix you accidently skipped while spamming reforge
2. Prevents duplicate rolls of prefixes if they have been rolled before (by default 5, configurable)

Notes:
* Undoing costs no money
* "Undo" button is only visible in the vanilla reforge menu. If other mods (such as "Auto-Reforge") replace it, it will not exist
* The config contains multiple customizations you can do
